-> TypeScript is Statically Typed language whereas JS is Dynamically Typed language(variable can change type during run time)
-> TypeScript: Javascript with type checking
-> It provides smart code complete based on type of variable
    > example: let num: number[] = [1,2,3]; now if we do num[0].{here it will tell possible functions only with number} 
-> TypeScript Code --> TS compiler(Converts to JS code) --> use JS code to run in browser JS engine
-> ABOUT TSCONFIG.JSON FILE:
                            > "target" : contains the ES version used by compiler(you can see all available versions by using ctr + space on the empty attribute)
                            > "rootDir" : contains the path of sorce directory of your TS code(default: './')
                            > "outDir" : contains path of JS files that will be generated by compiler once TS code is compiled
                            > "removeComments" : this removes all the comments in our TS file & generates comments free JS file
                            > "sourceMap" : this allows us to generate a map file once enabled(for machine).
